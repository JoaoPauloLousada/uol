# Object-Oriented Programming Principles

## Core OOP Principles

### 1. Encapsulation
### 2. Inheritance
### 3. Polymorphism
### 4. Abstraction
## SOLID Principles
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
## Design Patterns Guidelines
### Creational Patterns
### Structural Patterns
### Behavioral Patterns
## Best Practices
### Class Design
- Keep classes small and focused
- Use meaningful and descriptive class names
- Implement proper copy constructors and assignment operators when needed
- Follow the Rule of Three/Five/Zero in C++

### Method Design
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task
- Use const correctness in C++
- Prefer const references for parameters that won't be modified
- Make methods virtual when they might be overridden

### Memory Management
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles
- Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers in modern C++
- Ensure proper cleanup in destructors
- Avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers

### Code Organization
- Use namespaces to organize related classes
- Keep public interfaces minimal and stable
- Document class contracts and invariants
- Use forward declarations to reduce compilation dependencies

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **God Classes**: Avoid classes that do too much
- **Anemic Domain Model**: Don't create classes with only getters/setters and no behavior
- **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid classes that depend on each other
- **Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**: Keep inheritance trees shallow and focused
- **Interface Pollution**: Don't add methods to interfaces that not all implementers need

Always prioritize clean, maintainable, and extensible code that follows these object-oriented principles.
